    <h1>The Tea Method</h1>

    <p class="intro">Making the perfect mug every time is easy. Here's how:</p>
    
    <ol>
    	<li>Empty the contents of your kettle and re-fill it. The water must be fresh. Turn it on and let it boil. Please note that we want it to truly boil, not just bubble.</li>
    	<li>As soon as it's rolling, pour a little bit of the just-boiled water into a mug, swirl it round a bit, then pour it away. This is to warm the mug.</li>
    	<li>Now add a splash of milk and a teabag (and sugar, if that's your thing, but not too much!) to the empty mug, lift the kettle a foot above it, and slowly pour the water over the teabag. This will help oxygenate the tea.</li>
    	<li>Take a teaspoon and slowly stir (don't squeeze the teabag). If there are lots of bubbles, use the teabag to soak them up.</li>
    	<li>When the colour of the tea is to your liking (the darker it is, the stronger it tastes — three minutes is a good baseline), remove the teabag. Do not squeeze the colour from the bag — this will add bitterness, rather than flavour.</li>
    	<li>Enjoy the best, tastiest, most delicious cup of tea you've ever had.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    
    <p>We do the milk first because it's a bit easier to gauge how much you're putting in this way, and this way you won't get the film on the top. Also, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Adams">Douglas Adams</a> said so. If you'd like to get all fancy about it, use proper loose-leaf tea and a strainer. Good tea isn't always easy to pick in the states, nor is it easy to settle on a variety. If can highly recommend <a href="http://www.smithtea.com/">Smith Teamaker's</a> black teas as a starting point.
